GridChem is a Java application to launch and monitor computational chemistry calculations
on Computational Chemistry Grid (CCG) supercomputers from remote sites. The GridChem interface 
allows users to submit and monitor quantum chemistry jobs run on any computer accessable through 
the CCG community account or on which they have an allocation, without having to log in or to 
remember the unique features of each system. In future releases, when the CCG has taken full 
form, we envision making this process even more transparent to the userto the user, but for 
now we depend on the users to know which machines they are able to access. 

GridChem can submit input text files to Gaussian 98 and GAMESS suites currently. We intend to 
implement several other quantum chemistry applications such as NWChem, Molpro, Qchem, Aces, etc. 
in this interface in the future. A molecular editor is integrated into GridChem, and can be used to 
generate Gaussian input files. In addition, output files can be obtained from the remote hosts and parsed to 
create graphs and geometries extracted and viewed as molecular models.

GridChem also includes a generic job submission interface which allows users to leverage many
GridChem features on their own home grown codes. For more information on the SSH interface to
GridChem, please consult the User's Guide in the 'docs' directory of this checkout.

GridChem relies upon grid and Java technologies to ensure security and guarantee a 'single sign-on'
approach to computation.  This means that once the user authenticates to GridChem the first time, 
GridChem will securely act on their behalf for the remainder of the current session. GridChem currently 
supports three authentication methods: Kerberos, GSI, and Secure Shell.  In the near future, a fourth
option will be integrated - the GridChem community user.

2. More details on how to use GridChem can be found at http://www.gridchem.org.

3. Installation instructions are provided in the docs/INSTALL file included within this
   folder.

4. To change the URL of the Middleware server, go to "Invariants.java" and change the 
   values of string "kerbGateway" and "httpsGateway". You may also need to change 
   the URLs in cgi scripts.

5. To add a new application, you need to modify "editJobPanel.java" and "SubmitJob.java" and
   create a cgi script corresponding to this application. You may need to write CUP/Jflex files
   to analyze and parse the output files from this application.
